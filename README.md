# TWAT
Twin With A Twist (TWAT) is a website cloning with a twist.

## What is TWAT?

TWAT uses tools such as `httrack`, `beef-xss`, and `apache2` among others to create an authentic looking clone.

## What's with the name?

We came up with the longer version, `Twin With A Twist`, and didn't see anything wrong. It was only when we made this repo that we noticed the abbriviation.

## Are you gonna change it?

Should be fine, right?

## How does it work?

TWAT clones a website using `httrack`, then injects a `beef-xss` hook and hosts it locally using `apache2`. This makes an identical copy apart from the hook.

## Where can we find you?
